# hyprland-void

---

The repository contains port of [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/)
(wayland compositor based on wlroots) for
[Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org).

This repository was made originally by [kruceter](https://github.com/kruceter)
but was abandoned, so I decided to continue it.

If you encounter any problems and believe the template is to blame,
feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Installation

Clone this repository and put the `srcpkgs` directory into your local
copy of [void-packages](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages).

Refer to `xbps-src`'s instructions for building and installing packages
locally.

Follow Void's [documentation](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/graphical-session/wayland.html)
to set up environment for wayland compositors properly.

Do not forget to follow the [upstream tutorial](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Master-Tutorial),
too.

## Why not just submit it to void-packages?

Hyprland will not be accepted into the repository, this I can guarantee.

See <https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/37544>.
